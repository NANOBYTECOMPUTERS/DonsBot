## Overview
Dons Bot is a rewrite of Sunone_Aimbot. This is a Beta update so dont expect there will not ba a bug here and there.

It leverages the YOLOV11 models, PyTorch, and various other tools to automatically target and aim at enemies within the game. The AI model in repository has been trained on more than 30,000 images from popular first-person shooter games like Warface, Destiny 2, Battlefield (all series), Fortnite, The Finals, CS2 and more.

- Turn off the debug window.
- Do not use the `--half` option, it will not improve performance.
