I overwrote the master folder before I uploaded and I cant recover it,  working on resolutions







## Overview
Dons Bot is a rewrite of Sunone_Aimbot. It leverages the YOLOV11 models, PyTorch, and various other tools to automatically target and aim at enemies within the game. The AI model in repository has been trained on more than 30,000 images from popular first-person shooter games like Warface, Destiny 2, Battlefield (all series), Fortnite, The Finals, CS2 and more.

## Notes / Recommendations
- Set in game FPS 60 and 1080 x1920 resolution.
- medium or lower graphics settings in games.
- close all other apps dont try to stream unless you have a great gpu setup.
- Use the F3 key to pause the aimbot and F2 to wuit.
- export to `.engine`.
- Turn off the debug window.
- Do not use the `--half` option, it will not improve performance.
- Do not increase the object search window resolution, this may affect your search speed.
- If you have started the application and nothing happens, it may be working, close it with the F2 key and change the `show_window` option to `True` in the file [config.ini](https://github.com/SunOner/sunone_aimbot/blob/main/config.ini) to make sure that the application is working.
